                The name Jung Koch Quentell came to be as they were the last names of the three men, all scientists, who in the fifties designed the charts for the German publishing company Hagemann, which supplied learning aids to German Schools. Their aim was to create universal charts, without text, which would be easy to interpret for teachers in any language.

Important principles of these charts were that the colors were true (up to 10 colors per chart) and that the size of the charts were large enough to be seen by the entire classroom. The scientific rigor and artistic perfection they applied to creating these charts ensured their international success as learning aids.

              In the past two years I have received the following recognitions: Cartography awards: 2nd place Post Secondary, 2019 EsriUC Map Gallery and 3rd place Large Format Printed Maps, 2017 EsriUC Map Gallery; A series of my maps were published in the 2018 ESRI Map Book #33 and 2019 Map Book #34. I am a recent recipient of the HOW Regional Design Award, a prestigous design industry recognition. And recently placed first at the 2018 WAURISA conference map gallery for the Women in Stem map project (designed for the Washington Women in Geospatial Technology organization). I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies from <a href="https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/urban-studies/ms-program-overview">University of Washington</a> and work as a cartographer for the USDA Forest Service.</p>
